# dotfiles

My opinionated personal dotfiles

Listed are settings for
- zsh (with syntax highlighting)
- kitty terminal
- zathura pdf viewer

Other files of note are pacman hooks and miscellaneous configuration files for
my convenience. Much of this information has been gleaned from the Arch Wiki.

## TODO

- [ ] Add autocompletion/suggestions to zsh
- [ ] Modify [zsh vi-mode cursor behavior](https://github.com/RedPenguin88/dotfiles/issues/1)
- [ ] Integrate git status into prompt
- [ ] Add ability for lf to preview images :file_folder:
    - Possible through kitty?
