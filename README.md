# dotfiles

My opinionated personal dotfiles

Listed are settings for
- zsh (with syntax highlighting)
- kitty terminal

Other files of note are pacman hooks and miscellaneous configuration files for
my convenience. Much of this information has been gleaned from the Arch Wiki.

## TODO

- [ ] Add autocompletion/suggestions to zsh
